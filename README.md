# Sem2Project
This was a typing tutor made by us in our second semester using JavaFX.
It uses file handling to store and read the user data from files.
It had 2 modes one is a random Letters mode and the other is a paragrah typing mode which also tests your typing speed.
You will need JavaFX sdk 16 and JDK 16 to run the project, other wise it might cause some errors.
This was made in Intellij, so import the files in intellij setup the jdk and sdk to run it.
