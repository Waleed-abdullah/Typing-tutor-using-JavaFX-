Each society has first of all to determine what to produce. Let us explain what is meant by this with the help of an illustration. What to produce refers to the kind of goods to be produced and the quantities of each fo the goods to be produced. Take for example the cultivation fo crops on land. The producers of crops will have to decide whether to grow rice or sugarcane in their fields. If rice and sugarcane are already being produced by them they may have to decide whether they should put more land under rice and less land under sugarcane or vice versa. This depends, in a free market economy, on whether the demand for rice is going up or that of sugarcane is rising.
