A city needs many systems to stay healthy and grow. A system is a group of parts that work together to get a job done. No one part does everything by itself. The transportation system of a city has roads, buses, trucks, and cars to move people and supplies. The water system has drains, pipes, and pumps to move water through the city. The garbage system has trucks and dumps to keep the city clean. Many different systems meet the needs of a city's people. Like the people in a city, all of your cells have needs that must be met. How do they get food and oxygen? How do wastes get carried away? Like a city, your body has many systems to take care of it's cells.
